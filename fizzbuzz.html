<!--FizzBuzz

User is prompted to enter number. 

Page then COUNTS up to the number given by user, starting at one. Each number is on a new line.

That takes a FOR loop. This is the general syntax for a for loop:

 for (var i = 1; i < 11; i = i + 1) {
        code code code; 
    }

 for (start; end; increment) {
    // Do something! // usually console.log(i) //
}

For every number that is divisible by 3 (with remainder = 0), return "fizz".
For every number that is divisible by 5 (with remainder = 0), return "buzz".
For every number that is divisible by *both* 3 and 5 (with remainder = 0), return "fizzbuzz".

Simple, right?

I'm having trouble getting my javascript pages to show within the html document - why?

<!--for loop keeps executing until the statement "i > [usernumber] is false".-->
